# Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn in a banking dataset using various machine learning algorithms. 
Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company or stop using its services.
Predicting churn is crucial for businesses to retain customers and optimize their operations.
# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various features of bank customers, including credit score, geography, gender, age, tenure, balance, 
number of products, whether the customer has a credit card, whether the customer is an active member, and estimated salary.
# Steps

Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values, if any.
Encode categorical variables: Convert categorical variables like geography and gender into numerical format using label encoding or one-hot encoding.
Split the dataset into features (X) and target variable (y).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize the distribution of features.
Analyze correlations between features and target variable.
Identify trends and patterns in the data.

# Feature Engineering

Extract relevant features or create new features if needed.
Scale numerical features if necessary.

# Model Building

Implement various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree Classifier.
Train the models on the training dataset.
Evaluate the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Tune hyperparameters to improve model performance if required

# Model Evaluation

Compare the performance of different algorithms.
Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
Analyze model strengths and weaknesses.

# Results

Logistic Regression achieved perfect accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, indicating potential overfitting or data imbalance issues.
k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) achieved slightly lower performance compared to logistic regression.
Decision Tree Classifier also performed well with high accuracy and balanced precision and recall.
Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning algorithms for predicting customer churn in the banking sector. Further analysis and model refinement are necessary to deploy a reliable churn prediction system in real-world scenarios.

# Future Work

Experiment with additional machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Gradient Boosting.
Perform feature selection or dimensionality reduction techniques to improve model performance and interpretability.
Incorporate more advanced techniques such as ensemble learning or deep learning for better predictive accuracy.
